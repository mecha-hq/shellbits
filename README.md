# Mecha Shellbits

Atomic, self-contained, composable shell scripts and Makefiles to use for development and CI pipeline.

They are a library that can be used as is or as a reference for your own scripts.

Ideally it will grow in a framework with its own rules and conventions.

## Installation

Clone this repository and reference the scripts from there, or copy them to your own project within the scripts folder.

## Usage

This project goes hand in hand with makefiles, so you can use the scripts as makefile targets, or include the makefile provided here within your own project makefile.
